## 📖 What is Linux From Scratch (LFS)?

**Linux From Scratch (LFS)** is not just another Linux distribution — it's a comprehensive guide that teaches you how to build your own custom Linux system entirely from source code.

By following the LFS book, you gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of a Linux operating system. It walks you through the entire process of compiling and configuring software manually, allowing you to tailor the system to your specific needs.

> 🛠️ It’s not just about installing Linux — it’s about understanding **how Linux works under the hood**.

### 🎯 Why I Chose to Do This

I wanted to explore how a Linux system is built from the ground up, understand the complete boot process, and learn how components like the toolchain, kernel, init systems, and package managers work together. LFS provided a hands-on way to develop that understanding.
